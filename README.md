# Say Hello To FirstBot!

FirstBot is my first ever Discord bot.

He's a bit of a work in progress, but I have laid down a great foundation to build on.

# FirstBot Features:
## Event Listener
* Responds with "Hello (_username_)" when a message that a member types contains "Hello FirstBot" in any channel. Ignoring caps and spaces.


* When a member reacts to any message, FirstBot sends a message saying, "(_user_) reacted to a message with (_emoji reaction_) in the (_channel reaction occurred in_) channel!"


* When a member changes online status, FirstBot sends a message saying, "(_username_) updated their status to (_new status_)! There are now (_x_) user(s) online!"


* When a new member joins the server, FirstBot responds with "(_username_) has joined the server. Welcome them and have fun!"


* When a user types "ping", FirstBot replies with "pong."

## Slash Commands
* **Welcome Command** - FirstBot says "Welcome to the server, (_username_)"
* **Roles Command** - Prints out a list of all roles in the server.
* **Say Command** - Give FirstBot a message, and he will post the message on the channel the command was called from. Has an optional channel parameter that dictates what channel FistBot will post the message  in. Sends a confirmation Ephemeral message that can be dismissed or disappears on its own after some time.


### More features are planned to be added soon.
